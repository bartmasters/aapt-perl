Dear <xsl:value-of select="customer_name"/> 

At AAPT we aim to deliver great value backed by service that's friendly and
efficient. We're not too proud, however, to admit when we've made a mistake.

Unfortunately, due to a technical error which has now been corrected, you
would have received a number of e-mails from us on 22 June, confirming your
subscription to AAPT's Online Billing. We're sorry for any inconvenience
caused and would also like to assure you that this problem has now been
fixed.  There is no need for you to take any action or respond to this e-mail.

We look forward to continuing to bring you ongoing value with your AAPT services. 


The team at AAPT
