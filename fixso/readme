Instructions for installing/running fixso.pl

any questions can be directed to me - Bart Masters x1020

1. Overview
   I have been running some audit reports on BIOSS service orders,
   to test that their service order attributes are in a correct
   format (dates are dd-mm-ccyy, if the option is Yes or No, a Y or
   N has been entered etc).
   These reports have shown a lot of similar, basic errors.  Fixso.pl
   is a one-off program that has been written to fix these basic errors
   in the database.  In theory going forward data will be entered in the
   correct format, so this will not need to be run/supported regularly.

2. Program Spec
   *  Open a cursor on table service_orders for all service orders of
      the service type that is being processed (ie SPEEDNET1, SPEEDNET2
	  etc).
   *  Loop through service_orders, and for each service_order, open a 
      cursor on service_order_attributes that that service order.
   *  Loop through service_order_attributes, and check each attribute.
      If the attribute is one of the types listed before, process it.

	  Date
	  Speednet bit rate
	  Yes or No
	  CPE Model ID

	  All other service order attributes are not affected by this
	  program.

   *  If the attribute is one of the ones listed above - change its
      value based on the table below.

	  Before			After
	  
	  Date 
	  dd/mm/yy			dd-mm-yyyy

	  Speednet Rate
	  1.5MEG/256K		1.5M/256k
	  1.5m/256k			1.5M/256k
	  1500/256			1.5M/256k
	  1500kbps/256kbps	1.5M/256k
	  256/64			256k/64k
	  512/128			512k/128k

	  Yes or No
	  yes				Y
	  y					Y

	  CPE Model ID
	  827-4V			827 4V
	  Cisco 827			827

   *  Once the attribute has been changed, update it in the database, and
      move onto the next record.

3.  Files/logs
   *  The following file structure is assumed for running fixso.pl
      fixso/bin/	Location of fixso.pl and shell files
	  fixso/cfg/	Location of config files
	  fixso/lib/	Location of additional perl modules
	  fixso/log/	Location of log files produced by fixso.pl (it uses the
	  				module aapt::log to produce these)
	  
	  Logs are created in log/ with the name   servicetypedate.  These
	  logs list the records that have been changed, and what changes have
	  been performed.

4.  Installation/run instructions.
   *  Files should be extracted from fixso.tar.gz with their directory
      structure intact, this will place all files in their appropriate
	  directories.
	  Within fixso/bin/ are two shell scripts.
	  
	  fixso.sh will run fixso.pl against production BIOSS (ie glbncs4, sid
	  			bioss)
	  fixsouat.sh will run fixso.pl against buat BIOSS (ie glbncs5, buat)
	
	  Both these shell scripts are run with the usage
	  fixso.sh <username> <password>

	  The username/password are required to connect to bioss.  The
	  username must have update authority to service_order_attributes in
	  the appropriate bioss environment (buat or prod).

   *  This can be run from any machine that has perl installed and has 
      access to glbncs4 and glbncs5.  I've tested it on glbncs5 and it
	  has worked fine there.

   *  The shell scripts need to be run from the directory they are
      extracted to (ie from fixso/bin/).

   *  Runtime is not excessive - in the realm of 15-20 seconds elapsed
      runtime.
